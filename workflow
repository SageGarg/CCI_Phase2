•	Step-2: 
ISU personnel sync the videos from all cameras using X. 
•	Step-3: 
The synced video is then divided into hourly segments using X. These 24 videos are put in the respective Hour folder which is inside the date folder inside the synced folder. There are 24 hour folders representing 24 hours.
